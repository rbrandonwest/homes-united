HomesUnited is a non-profit organization that seeks to end homelessness in South Florida.
The main thrust behind the organization is placing homeless individuals in
comfortable living accomodations across nearly 100 homes.

With that, managing the vacancies in the homes and tracking who is in what bed
can be a complex and challenging process. This application helps to solve that.
